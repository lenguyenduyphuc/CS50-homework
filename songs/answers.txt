    'Calculating the audio aura solely based on the average energy, valence, and danceability may not fully capture the listener's emotional and psychological state. This method overlooks factors such as lyrical content, genre diversity, listening context, and temporal changes in mood throughout the year. A more representative approach could involve incorporating additional audio features like tempo, acousticness, and instrumentalness, as well as considering the variance and distribution of these metrics. Additionally, integrating user-specific data such as listening times, playlists, and contextual activities can provide a more nuanced and accurate reflection of the listener's true audio aura.'
